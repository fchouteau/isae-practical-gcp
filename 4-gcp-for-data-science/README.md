# Google Cloud Platform for Data Science Workshop

Do as much as you can :) You can do that as home as well

It is necessary to have done 1. and 2. before leaving !

## 1. Deploying a model in a scalable fashion using cloud run

[Finish Last Part](../3-deploy-model-into-production)

## 2. Creating a Jupyter AI Notebook Instance from the GUI

- Go to AI Notebook CLI
- Add a New Instance

## 3. Discover Google Colaboratory

- Go to https://colab.research.google.com while logged in on a google account (if you have one)
- Load any notebook you have locally, or on github or on MLClass
    - For example the "Time Series Forecasting BE" you are working on
    - Use the "load from github" if necessary
    - Example: https://github.com/erachelson/MLclass/blob/master/11%20-%20Random%20Forests/Random%20Forests.ipynb
- Make run work end-to-end without errors
    - Select the proper runtime and python version
    - You may need to install things, `!pip install {my-package}`
    - Refer to the built-in docs for more information
- Share it using a public link...
- ... And open it from a private browser tab !

You're done !

## 4. Schedule the execution and retrieve a notebook

From cloud shell,

We are going to use [Papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) to schedule a computation of a notebook

For example this one:

## 5. Preparation for the Deep Learning Class this afternoon

- Using either colaboratory or jupyter ai notebook
- Open this notebook https://github.com/erachelson/MLclass/tree/master/7%20-%20Deep%20Learning

Don't run it just yet ;)

## Troubleshooting

**No GPU ?**
